## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Run JDBC Example

1. Update `src/App.java` with your database name, user, and password.
2. Compile with:
   ```bash
   javac -cp lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.30.jar -d bin src/App.java
   ```
3. Run with:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin:lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.30.jar App
   ```
